## API 
`enable_blob_files`: set it to true to enable kv separation
`enable_blob_garbage_collection`: set this to this to true to make BlobDB actively 
relocate valid blobs from the oldest blob files as they are encountered 
during compaction
`blob_garbage_collection_age_cutoff`: the threshold that the GC logic uses to 
determine which blob files should be considered "old".

The above options can be changed via SetOptions API

Use Leveled Compaction style combined with BlobDB


Lifetime for each key. 
How many keys are GCed during one GC ? 


## File related to GC 
What is Blob ? A file ? 
Does Rocksdb GC a whole file instead of individual keys ? 
db/compaction/compaction_iterator.cc
    CompactionIterator::PrepareOutput()
    CompactionIterator::GarbageCollectBlobIfNeeded()

Each time CompactionIterator::Next() is called  CompactionIterator::PrepareOutput()
 is called to write large value to blob or GC blob value.

 There is no lifetime statistics for each key right now. 
 Let's do it .

Rocksdb has already implemented that timestamp can be added to internalkey.
I can use this

How can I enable timestamp to be written to internalkey when Flush is scheduled?
db/db_with_timestamp_test_util.h
Check db_bench help. We can use ComparatorWithU64TsImpl
But I am not sure if Flush will write timestamp

Want to find that how we can add timestamp to each internal key
flush_job.cc
FlushJob::WriteLevel0Table()
    Status BuildTable()

Still don't find out how timestamp is written when key is put. Start from the top
function.
Timestamp is written as part of the key when DB::Put() is called.
So now I think we can collection information about the lifetime of each key during 
compaction. 

one thing I don't  know is that how many times of compaction through which the key 
has to go before it's actually GCed.

Rocksdb choose a GC method that's different from that in Wisckey. GC is perfromaned 
during compaction. 
Does this mean that each SSTable has a corresponding Blob ? So we may still have 
large write amplification. 
This feels not right. 
I need to do check about this .


Compaction code is in ProcessKeyValueCompaction() function 
We have BlobBuilder and CompactionIterator here.


CompactionJobStat is a struct we can use to do statistics about lifetime for each key
in one compaction.


What does force threshold mean? 
Need to figure out how these parameters work.

Trying to figure out how GC can be triggered. 
Right now I am not seeing GC triggered.


Only see kForcedBlobGC CompactionReason.

Read LOG and figure out that I can search log keywords in the codebase to see
 how GC can be triggered.

Can't figure our.
Let's set enable_blob_garbage_collection=1.0 to see if GC can be triggered with 100%
cerntainty.
